# Fantasy Sports Player Scoring App

A comprehensive Python application for managing fantasy sports players with sophisticated weighted scoring system that prioritizes recent performance.

## Features

- **Player Database**: Store and manage hundreds of player records with team, position, and performance data
- **Weighted Scoring**: Advanced algorithm that calculates player scores using weighted averages, giving more importance to recent game weeks
- **Sortable Leaderboard**: Players automatically ranked by their final weighted scores
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application with multiple views
- **Database Filtering**: View players by teams and positions
- **Detailed Analytics**: Individual player breakdowns showing score calculations

## Scoring Formula

The app uses a weighted average formula that emphasizes recent performance:

```
Final Score = (Week1√ó1 + Week2√ó2 + ... + WeekN√óN) √∑ (1+2+...+N)
```

This ensures that a player's most recent games have the highest impact on their final ranking, reflecting their current form.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the app on any platform is using the provided launcher scripts:

**Cross-Platform Python Launcher:**
```bash
python launcher.py
# OR on some systems:
python3 launcher.py
```

**Platform-Specific Scripts:**

**Windows:**
```cmd
launch.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
```

These launchers will:
- Check your Python version
- Install dependencies automatically
- Provide a menu to choose console or web app
- Handle platform-specific differences

### Manual Launch

### Console Application

Run the console version to see a simple leaderboard:

**On Windows:**
```cmd
python main.py
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 main.py
# OR if python points to Python 3:
python main.py
```

This will:
- Initialize the database with sample data
- Display the current leaderboard
- Add a sample player
- Show the updated leaderboard

### Web Application

Start the Flask web server:

**On Windows:**
```cmd
python app.py
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 app.py
# OR if python points to Python 3:
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`

#### Alternative Launch Methods:

**Using Flask's built-in command (all platforms):**
```bash
flask --app app run
# OR with debug mode:
flask --app app run --debug
```

**Using Python module execution (all platforms):**
```bash
python -m flask --app app run
# OR on macOS/Linux:
python3 -m flask --app app run
```

#### Web Features:

- **Leaderboard** (`/`): View all players ranked by weighted score with quick edit/delete actions
- **Add Player** (`/add_player`): Add new players to the database
- **Player Details** (`/player/<name>`): Detailed breakdown with calculation details and edit/delete buttons
- **Edit Player** (`/edit_player/<name>`): Modify existing player information and scores
- **Teams** (`/teams`): View players grouped by their teams
- **Positions** (`/positions`): View players grouped by their positions
- **Manage Data** (`/manage_data`): Comprehensive data management with bulk delete operations
- **API** (`/api/leaderboard`): JSON endpoint for programmatic access

## Database

The app uses **SQLite** for local data storage, which provides **persistent data storage** between sessions.

### Data Persistence

**‚úÖ YES - Your data is automatically saved!**

- **Database File**: `fantasy_players.db` (created automatically in the app directory)
- **Persistent Storage**: All player data, scores, teams, and positions are saved permanently
- **Cross-Session**: Data remains intact when you close and reopen the app
- **Offline Support**: No internet connection required after initial setup

### Database Features

- **Automatic Creation**: Database and tables are created automatically on first run
- **SQLite Format**: Lightweight, file-based database (no server required)
- **ACID Compliance**: Data integrity guaranteed with proper transaction handling
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple app instances can safely read the same database

### Database Schema

The database file contains a `players` table with the following structure:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `name` | TEXT | Player name (unique) |
| `team` | TEXT | Team name |
| `position` | TEXT | Player position |
| `scores` | TEXT | JSON array of game scores |
| `final_score` | REAL | Calculated weighted score |

### Data Lifecycle

1. **First Launch**: 
   - Database file is created
   - Sample data is inserted (if database is empty)
   - Players are stored permanently

2. **Subsequent Launches**:
   - Existing database is loaded
   - All previous data is preserved
   - New players can be added
   - Existing players can be updated

3. **Data Location**:
   - **File**: `fantasy_players.db` in the app directory
   - **Backup**: Copy this file to backup your data
   - **Migration**: Move this file to transfer data to another location

### Sample Data Behavior

The app includes sample players that are added **only once**:
- Sample data is inserted only if the database is empty
- On subsequent launches, sample data insertion is skipped
- Your added players persist alongside the original sample data

### Practical Examples

**Scenario 1: First Time Launch**
```bash
python launcher.py
# ‚Üí Creates fantasy_players.db
# ‚Üí Adds 5 sample players (John Smith, Sarah Johnson, etc.)
# ‚Üí Shows leaderboard with sample data
```

**Scenario 2: Second Launch (Offline)**
```bash
python launcher.py
# ‚Üí Loads existing fantasy_players.db
# ‚Üí Shows same players from previous session
# ‚Üí No sample data re-insertion
# ‚Üí All your custom players are still there
```

**Scenario 3: Adding New Players**
```bash
# Add player via web interface or console
# ‚Üí Player is permanently saved to database
# ‚Üí Available in all future sessions
# ‚Üí Survives app restarts, computer reboots, etc.
```

**Scenario 4: Data Backup/Transfer**
```bash
# Copy fantasy_players.db to backup location
# Move fantasy_players.db to new computer
# ‚Üí All data transfers with the file
```

## Sample Data

The application comes with sample data including:

- **Players**: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Davis, Emily Wilson, Chris Brown
- **Teams**: Team A, Team B, Team C
- **Positions**: Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper
- **Scores**: 5 game weeks of sample performance data

## VS Code Tasks

Pre-configured tasks are available in VS Code:

- **Run Fantasy App (Console)**: Execute the console version
- **Run Fantasy App (Web)**: Start the web server

Access these via Terminal ‚Üí Run Task in VS Code.

## API Usage

### Get Leaderboard Data

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/leaderboard
```

Returns JSON array of all players with their calculated scores.

- `app.py`: Web interface
- `main.py`: Console interface

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Python Command Not Found
**Problem:** `python: command not found` or `python3: command not found`

**Solutions:**
- **Windows**: Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- **macOS**: Install Python using Homebrew: `brew install python3`
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
- **Linux (CentOS/RHEL)**: `sudo yum install python3 python3-pip`

#### Module Not Found Errors
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure you're using the correct pip
pip --version      # Should match your Python version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you have multiple Python versions:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Port Already in Use
**Problem:** `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Kill process using port 5000
# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# On macOS/Linux:
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill
# OR use a different port:
python app.py
# Then modify app.py to use app.run(port=5001)
```

#### Database Permission Issues
**Problem:** Database file cannot be created or accessed

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure write permissions in the directory
chmod 755 .                    # On macOS/Linux
# OR run from user's home directory
# OR specify a different database path in the code
```

#### Reset Database
**Problem:** Want to start fresh with clean data

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Delete the database file (loses all data!)
rm fantasy_players.db          # macOS/Linux
del fantasy_players.db         # Windows

# OR rename to keep as backup
mv fantasy_players.db fantasy_players_backup.db    # macOS/Linux
ren fantasy_players.db fantasy_players_backup.db   # Windows
```

#### Database File Missing
**Problem:** `fantasy_players.db` file accidentally deleted

**Solutions:**
- App will automatically recreate the database on next launch
- Sample data will be re-inserted
- Custom players will be lost (unless you have a backup)
- **Prevention**: Regularly backup your `fantasy_players.db` file

#### Flask Debug Mode Issues
**Problem:** Auto-reload not working or debugger issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Set environment variables (cross-platform)
export FLASK_ENV=development    # macOS/Linux
set FLASK_ENV=development       # Windows CMD
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"    # Windows PowerShell

# OR modify app.py directly:
app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- Use `python` command (usually points to Python 3)
- Use Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Antivirus software may interfere with database file creation

#### macOS
- May need to use `python3` command explicitly
