## Scoring Formula

The app uses a weighted average formula that emphasizes recent performance:

```
Final Score = (Week1√ó1 + Week2√ó2 + ... + WeekN√óN) √∑ (1+2+...+N)
```

This ensures that a player's most recent games have the highest impact on their final ranking, reflecting their current form within each league.

## Database

The app uses **SQLite** for local data storage, which provides **persistent data storage** between sessions.

### Data Persistence

**‚úÖ YES - Your data is automatically saved!**

- **Database File**: `fantasy_players.db` (created automatically in the app directory)
- **Persistent Storage**: All player data, scores, teams, and positions are saved permanently
- **Cross-Session**: Data remains intact when you close and reopen the app
- **Offline Support**: No internet connection required after initial setup

### Database Features

- **Automatic Creation**: Database and tables are created automatically on first run
- **SQLite Format**: Lightweight, file-based database (no server required)
- **ACID Compliance**: Data integrity guaranteed with proper transaction handling
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple app instances can safely read the same database

### Database Schema

The database file contains a `players` table with the following structure:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `name` | TEXT | Player name (unique) |
| `team` | TEXT | Team name |
| `position` | TEXT | Player position |
| `scores` | TEXT | JSON array of game scores |
| `final_score` | REAL | Calculated weighted score |
| `is_on_my_team` | BOOLEAN | Whether player is on your fantasy team (0/1) |

### Database Migration

If you're upgrading from an older version, the app includes automatic database migration:

```bash
python migrate_db.py
```

This script will:
- Check if the `is_on_my_team` column exists
- Add the column if missing (defaults to 0/False for existing players)
- Preserve all existing data
- Enable team management features

### Data Lifecycle

1. **First Launch**: 
   - Database file is created
   - Sample data is inserted (if database is empty)
   - Players are stored permanently

2. **Subsequent Launches**:
   - Existing database is loaded
   - All previous data is preserved
   - New players can be added
   - Existing players can be updated

3. **Data Location**:
   - **File**: `fantasy_players.db` in the app directory
   - **Backup**: Copy this file to backup your data
   - **Migration**: Move this file to transfer data to another location

### Sample Data Behavior

The app includes sample players that are added **only once**:
- Sample data is inserted only if the database is empty
- On subsequent launches, sample data insertion is skipped
- Your added players persist alongside the original sample data

### Practical Examples

**Scenario 1: First Time Launch**
```bash
python launcher.py
# ‚Üí Creates fantasy_players.db
# ‚Üí Adds 5 sample players (John Smith, Sarah Johnson, etc.)
# ‚Üí Shows leaderboard with sample data
```

**Scenario 2: Second Launch (Offline)**
```bash
python launcher.py
# ‚Üí Loads existing fantasy_players.db
# ‚Üí Shows same players from previous session
# ‚Üí No sample data re-insertion
# ‚Üí All your custom players are still there
```

**Scenario 3: Adding New Players**
```bash
# Add player via web interface or console
# ‚Üí Player is permanently saved to database
# ‚Üí Available in all future sessions
# ‚Üí Survives app restarts, computer reboots, etc.
```

**Scenario 4: Data Backup/Transfer**
```bash
# Copy fantasy_players.db to backup location
# Move fantasy_players.db to new computer
# ‚Üí All data transfers with the file
```

## Sample Data

The application comes with sample data including:

- **Players**: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Davis, Emily Wilson, Chris Brown
- **Teams**: Team A, Team B, Team C
- **Positions**: Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper
- **Scores**: 5 game weeks of sample performance data

## VS Code Tasks

Pre-configured tasks are available in VS Code:

- **Run Fantasy App (Console)**: Execute the console version
- **Run Fantasy App (Web)**: Start the web server

Access these via Terminal ‚Üí Run Task in VS Code.

## API Usage

## Troubleshooting

### Checking if the Web App is Running

Sometimes you may access the web interface and find it's not responding. Here are several ways to check if the Flask app is running:

#### Method 1: Use the Status Checker Script (Recommended)
```bash
python status_checker.py
```
This interactive script will:
- Check if the app is running and responding
- Show the process ID if running
- Provide options to start/stop the app
- Open the app in your browser

#### Method 2: Check Port Usage (Windows)
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```
- If you see output with "LISTENING", the app is running
- The PID (Process ID) will be shown in the last column
- If no output, the app is not running

#### Method 3: Check Port Usage (macOS/Linux)
```bash
lsof -i :5000
# OR
netstat -tlnp | grep :5000
```

#### Method 4: Test HTTP Response
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000
# OR open in browser: http://localhost:5000
```
- If you get HTML content, the app is running
- If connection refused/timeout, the app is not running

#### Method 5: Check Running Python Processes
**Windows:**
```cmd
tasklist | findstr python
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ps aux | grep python
ps aux | grep app.py
```

### Starting/Restarting the Web App

#### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "path/to/fantasy"

# Start the web app
python app.py
```

#### Background Process (Keeps Running)
**Windows (PowerShell):**

# Start as background job
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { python app.py }

# Check job status
Get-Job

# Stop job
Get-Job | Stop-Job
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
# Start minimized (stays running when you close terminal)
start /min python app.py
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Start in background
nohup python3 app.py &

# Check if running
jobs
ps aux | grep app.py

# Kill background process
pkill -f app.py
```

### Keeping the App Running Permanently

2. Select "Run Fantasy App (Web)"
3. The task runs in the background and shows status in VS Code terminal
4. To stop: Click the trash can icon in the terminal

#### Option 2: Windows Service (Advanced)
Create a Windows service using tools like NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager):
```cmd
# Install NSSM from https://nssm.cc/
nssm install FantasyApp "C:\path\to\python.exe" "C:\path\to\fantasy\app.py"
nssm start FantasyApp
```

#### Option 3: Screen/Tmux (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Using screen
screen -S fantasy
python3 app.py
# Press Ctrl+A then D to detach

# Reattach later
screen -r fantasy

# Using tmux
tmux new -s fantasy
python3 app.py

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Python Command Not Found
**Problem:** `python: command not found` or `python3: command not found`

**Solutions:**
- **Windows**: Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- **macOS**: Install Python using Homebrew: `brew install python3`
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
- **Linux (CentOS/RHEL)**: `sudo yum install python3 python3-pip`

#### Module Not Found Errors
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure you're using the correct pip
pip --version      # Should match your Python version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you have multiple Python versions:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Port Already in Use
**Problem:** `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Kill process using port 5000
# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# On macOS/Linux:
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill
# OR use a different port:
python app.py
# Then modify app.py to use app.run(port=5001)
```

#### Database Permission Issues
**Problem:** Database file cannot be created or accessed

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure write permissions in the directory
chmod 755 .                    # On macOS/Linux
# OR run from user's home directory
# OR specify a different database path in the code
```

#### Reset Database
**Problem:** Want to start fresh with clean data

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Delete the database file (loses all data!)
rm fantasy_players.db          # macOS/Linux
del fantasy_players.db         # Windows

# OR rename to keep as backup
mv fantasy_players.db fantasy_players_backup.db    # macOS/Linux
ren fantasy_players.db fantasy_players_backup.db   # Windows
```

#### Database File Missing
**Problem:** `fantasy_players.db` file accidentally deleted

**Solutions:**
- App will automatically recreate the database on next launch
- Sample data will be re-inserted
- Custom players will be lost (unless you have a backup)
- **Prevention**: Regularly backup your `fantasy_players.db` file

#### Flask Debug Mode Issues
**Problem:** Auto-reload not working or debugger issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Set environment variables (cross-platform)
export FLASK_ENV=development    # macOS/Linux
set FLASK_ENV=development       # Windows CMD
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"    # Windows PowerShell

# OR modify app.py directly:
app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- Use `python` command (usually points to Python 3)
- Use Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Antivirus software may interfere with database file creation

#### macOS
- May need to use `python3` command explicitly
- Use Terminal application
- Xcode Command Line Tools may be required: `xcode-select --install`
